## Project Overview

This project analyzes sales budget data to extract meaningful information about products and customers based on multiple features. It includes data cleaning (ETL), exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the creation of an interactive Power BI dashboard to review company performance.

Key objectives include:

- Extract, transform, and load (ETL) the sales and budget dataset  
- Perform exploratory data analysis using Python  
- Compare actual sales with budgeted sales and calculate variances  
- Identify key metrics and relationships between sales, products, customers, and regions  
- Build interactive dashboards to visualize performance trends and support decision making

## Dataset

The dataset includes detailed sales and budget information by product, customer, region, and time period. It contains features such as sales amounts, budgeted targets, quantities ordered, customer demographics, and order dates.

Files included:

- `Budget and Sales Data.xlsx` — Raw budget and sales data  
- `budget_and_sales_data_hqtl.xlsx` — Cleaned and processed dataset

## Insights and Conclusions

- Significant sales growth observed in 2016, especially in bike category products.  
- Customers aged 40-59 form a large portion of the clientele with high demand.  
- Highest profits recorded in June, November, and December.  
- Sales orders peak on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  
- Negative correlation between price and quantity ordered observed.  
- Customer retention improved slightly in 2016 compared to 2014.  
- High school diploma holders with moderate income tend to purchase more than those with bachelor's degrees.  
- Approximately 15% of customers are high-value clients, with the majority being low-value or lost clients.
